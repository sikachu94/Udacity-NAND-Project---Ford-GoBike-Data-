## Ford GoBike System Trip Data

> The Ford GoBike System dataset is a database of over 180,000 bike rides in the city of San Francisco. This data set includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area during the month of February. This analysis aims to show the relationship between frequency of bike rides and time of day and day of week, as well as take a glance at some of the factors that lead to longer bike rides.

<br>Q3. Do subscribers take longer trips on average than customers?
<br>Q4. Do customers take longer bike rides on average than subscribers throughout the day/week?
<br>Throughout exploration of the GoBike system data, I have discovered that bike riding patterns differ between the weekdays and the weekend. Furthermore, there is a relationship between the type of the user riding a Ford GoBike and the duration of the bike ride.
